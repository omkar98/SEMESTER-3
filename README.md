2. Implement stack data structure and its operations (PUSH and POP).
3. Write a program for conversion of infix expression into postfix using stack.
4. Write a program for evaluation of the postfix expression using stack.
5. Write a program to check the imbalance of parenthesis using stack.
6. Implement a simple queue and its operations.
7. Implement circular queue and its operations.
8. Implement a double ended queue and its operations.
9. Write a program for recursive solution of problem of Tower of Hanoi.
10. Write a program for the Fibonacci series using recursion.
11. Write a menu driven program to perform following operations on singly linked list:
create, insert(from beginning and end), delete(from beginning and end) and display the elements 
12. Write a menu driven program to perform following operations on circular linked list:
create, insert(from beginning and end), delete(from beginning and end) and display the elements.
13. Represent polynomial as a circularly linked list and write a menu driven program to perform addition.
14. Implementation of binary tree data structure and perform pre-order, post-order and in-order traversals.
15. Write a program for implementation of graph data structure using adjacency list representation.
16. Write a Program for implementation of graph data structure using adjacency matrix representation.
